# Crypto-LLM-bot
Version 1:
This bot is designed to provide answers solely related to cryptocurrency.

The bot identifies the type of query that the user has asked and, based on that, retrieves data using APIs from various sources.

The bot categorizes user queries into four types:

- Realtime: Returns price and volume data for any cryptocurrency coin.
- News: Answers news-related queries.
- Sentiment: Provides market sentiment analysis.
- Technical: Provides technical indicators such as RSI, EMA, and MACD.

While working on this project, I realized that the segmentation of queries into these types can be easily accomplished by agents and tools. Therefore, this version of the bot (v1) is currently developed without agents.

However, there are some limitations with this approach, such as scalability. Therefore, I will work on a subsequent version (v2) that will incorporate agents.
